## Final Notes

This is my first project using JavaScript, and there's a lot of new information to absorb. Since it's my first attempt, none of the knowledge has sedimented yet. I had a similar experience with my first HTML and CSS challenge, project, but after completing six projects, I became more comfortable with coding and started to get the hang of it. Now, I can do most of the coding without constantly referring to documentation.I'm aware, however, that JavaScript is a more complex language that will demand some more practice. Recently, I've encountered some setbacks that slowed me down, but I'm determined to keep pushing forward. Overall, I'm happy with the progress I've made so far, and I look forward to continuing to learn and improve.
